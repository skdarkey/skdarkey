# Selorm Komla DarkeyðŸ‘‹


Selorm is a Data Analyst who seeks above all things to use his professional skills, knowledge, and resources to contribute to a sustainable society. I strive for quality education because I believes that the poverty of knowledge only breeds limitations to my thoughts and ability to live fully. This principle led me to develop high-level knowledge and practical skills in Geospatial technologies (GIS, Remote Sensing) and Data Science. 

I deem my life fulfilled when my activities, initiatives, and contributions impact to lift others up on their journeys to sustainable success!!!
